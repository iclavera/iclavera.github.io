<p>I am a first-year PhD student in CS at <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/" title="EECS UC Berkeley" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> advised by <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/" title="Pieter Abbeel" target="_blank">Pieter Abbeel</a> in the <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/" title="BAIR" target="_blank">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> Lab.</p>

<p>My main research goal is to develop algorithms which enable robotic systems to learn how to perform complex tasks quickly and efficiently in a variety of unstructured environments. I am currently working in the areas of transfer learning and quick adaptation for Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms applied to robotic systems. I am also working on getting robotic hands to be able to learn a variety of complex dexterous skills using Deep Reinforcement Learning. In the past I have worked on video prediction, learning from demonstration and hierarchical planning.</p>
